# CECS343_TermProject_Spring2016
The term project focused on creating documentation for a software. Our group came up with an mobile application idea called Handyman. The application allowed people to list themselves as professionals in different field. Based on the need, users request for different jobs which are taken by the handymen. The project includes Request For Proposal (RFP), Scenarios, Use-Cases, and Requirement Analysis Document.
